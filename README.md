# SC1015-Mini-Project
Hi Everyone! This is a mini-project for our SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning module at NTU. Our team consists of Eugene Wee, Clare Yeo and Guo Zhiqi. We hope to apply our skills learnt from this course, to transform raw unprocessed data into charts for analysis as well as to solve a real-world business problem.
