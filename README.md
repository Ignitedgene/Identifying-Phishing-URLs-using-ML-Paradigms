# SC1015-Mini-Project
<h2> Introduction </h2> 
  <p> Hi Everyone! This is a mini-project for our SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning module at NTU. Our team consists of Eugene Wee, Clare Yeo and Guo Zhiqi. For this project, our team identified the rising trend of phishing attacks and we sought to create a machine learning model to effectively identify which URLs are phishing in nature. We tested out different machine learning models, evaluated them based on classification accuracy, and tried to improve each model's performance.

<h3> Problem Statement </h3> 
  <p> The number of phishing scams in Singapore jumped from 16 cases in 2017 to 5,020 in 2022. 
  </p>

<h3> Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </h3> 
  <p> 

<h3> Machine Learning Model Training & Evaluation </h3> 
  <p> We decided to run the following ML models and evaluate their respective performances:
      <ul> 
        <li> Decision Tree (DT) </li>
        <li> Random Forest </li>
        <li> Logistic Regression/ Support Vector Machine (SVM) </li> 
      </ul>
  </p> 
  
  <p> During Model Building, we will be running 2 rounds with the following model inputs:
      <ol>
        <li> PCA components (Top 15)</li>
        <li> PCA components (Top 15)  + Variables with Feature Importance (Top 5)</li>
      </ol>
  
<h3> Model Improvements - Feature Selection </h3> 

<h3> Model Improvements - Ensembling </h3>
  <p> We also decided to conduct ensembling across the 3 different models to obtain better prediction and performance. </p> 

<h3> Presentation of Insights/ Recommendation </h3> 

<h3> Learning Outcome :D </h3>
